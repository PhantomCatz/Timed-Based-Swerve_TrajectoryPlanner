# Trajectory-Planner

Combines advantage kit cmd based framework with trajectory planner code

Code is written in cmd based(for testing and for easier out of the box organization)

Currenly working out the logic of the entire code structure

Will mostly likely need to split the code in order fix issues with advantagekit and trajectory planner indiviually
